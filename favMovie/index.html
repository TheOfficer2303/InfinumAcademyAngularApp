			<h1 class="title" id="movie-title">Death Note</h1>
			<p id="description">The story follows Light Yagami, a teen genius who discovers a mysterious notebook: the "Death
				Note", which belonged to the Shinigami Ryuk, and grants the user the supernatural ability to kill anyone whose
				name is written in its pages. The series centers around Light's subsequent attempts to use the Death Note to
				carry out a worldwide massacre of individuals whom he deems immoral and to create a crime-free society, using
				the alias of a god-like vigilante named "Kira", and the subsequent efforts of an elite Japanese police task
				force, led by enigmatic detective L, to apprehend him.</p>
